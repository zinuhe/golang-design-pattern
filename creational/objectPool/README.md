# Object Pool - Creational Design Pattern

The Object Pool Design Pattern is a creational design pattern in which a pool of objects is initialized and created beforehand and kept in a pool. As and when needed, a client can request an object from the pool, use it, and return it to the pool. The object in the pool is never destroyed.
