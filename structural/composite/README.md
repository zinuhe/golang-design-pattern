# Composite - Structural Design Pattern
Composition design pattern is used when we want a Group of objects called ‘composite’ is treated in a similar way as a single object. It comes under structural design pattern as it allows you to compose objects into a tree structure. Each of the individual objects in the tree structure can be treated in the same way irrespective of whether they are Complex or Primitive.
Let’s try to understand it with an example of a file system of OS. In the file system, there are two types of objects File and Folder. There are cases when File and Folder are treated to be the same way. It will be more clear as we go along.
