# Null Object - Behavioral Design Pattern

Null Object Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern. It is useful when the client code relies upon some dependency which can be null. Using this design pattern prevents clients from having to put null checks on the result of these dependencies. With that said, it should also be noted that client behavior is also fine with such null dependencies.
